Word of God

That was a wake-up call. The Lord allowed this to happen to get his attention.

God brings wake-up calls into our lives or puts obstacles in our paths when we’re going the wrong direction. It starts with our conscience, that little warning buzzer that goes off when we’re doing things we shouldn’t do.

If we’re persistent, our free will ultimately will prevail, and God will allow us to do what we want to do. He will not force His will in our lives, but He will remind us of what His will is.
